Sector | Sector | This variable says which of the 40 sectors in the model is concerned. 20 of the sectors are tradable, and 20 are non-trabable, thus have the character of infrastructure.
Dest_C | Dest_C | The destination country for the respective trade flow and tariffs.
Source_C | Source_C | The source country for the respective trade flow and tariffs. This is also the country for which the gross output and sectoral value added data is given.
Tariffs1993 | Tariffs1993 | In 1993, what was the (weighted average) tariff rate in the given sector, for an import into the destination country from the source country? Values are given in percent.

GO_Source | GO_Source | What is the gross output in the given sector in the source country (in million dollars)?
VA_Source | VA_Source | Which percentage of the value of the output from the given sector in the source country is added within the sector? Thus, (100-"VA_Source") percent of the value of the output is determined by the value of the input of materials and services.
Trade_Vol | Trade_Vol | The bilateral trade flow from the source country to the destination country in the given sector (in million dollars). Note that values are given with tariffs excluded.
Trade_Elast | Trade_Elast | This variable is explained in detail in Exercise Trade Elasticities.

NAFTA_Dest | NAFTA_Dest | Is the destination country: a)Canada, b)Mexico, c)USA, d)nonafta

Country | Country | This variable says which of the 31 countries is concerned. One of the countries in the model, "Remaining World", is constructed from the countries that lack individual data. It is introduced into the model to capture trade globally.
Source_S | Source_S | This is the sector whose output is employed (partially) in sector "Dest_S".
Dest_S | Dest_S | This is the sector where some of the output of sector "Source_S" is used.
IO_Coeff | IO_Coeff | The input-output coefficient states which percentage of the output of sector "Source_S" is employed or consumed in sector "Dest_S".

sector | sector | This variable says which of the 40 sectors in the model is concerned. 20 of the sectors are tradable, and 20 are non-trabable, thus have the caracter of infrastructure.
y | y | In the regression in Exercise 5 that is designed to estimate the thetas (equation 11), this is the dependent variable, thus the left-hand side.
x | x |  In the regression in Exercise 5 that is designed to estimate the thetas (equation 11), this is the independent variable, thus the term with the six tau tilde.
d1 | d1 | In the current pair of x-y values, is this country one of the three concerned countries? Here, in 'd1': Is Argentina one of the three countries?
